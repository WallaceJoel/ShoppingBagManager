# ShoppingBagManager
Implement an array-based container class ShoppingBag and use it to hold a list of grocery items. An instance of the ShoppingBag class is a growable bag with an initial capacity of holding 5 grocery items, and automatically grows (increases) the capacity by 5 whenever it is full.
